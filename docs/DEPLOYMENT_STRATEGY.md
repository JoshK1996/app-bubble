### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline for deploying the Construction Material Tracking System consists of the following stages:

1. **Source Code Management**:
   - GitHub repository with branch-based workflows
   - Main branches: `development`, `staging`, `production`

2. **Build Process**:
   - Automated builds triggered by commits to designated branches
   - Separate build configurations for frontend and backend
   - Environment-specific variables injected at build time

3. **Testing**:
   - Automated unit and integration tests run during build
   - End-to-end tests for critical workflows
   - Security scanning and code quality checks

4. **Deployment**:
   - Automated deployment to environment-specific backends
   - Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
   - Progressive rollout capabilities

### Multi-Environment Strategy

The system employs a multi-environment deployment model to support the full development lifecycle:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Connected to `development` branch
   - Used for active development and feature integration
   - Potentially less stable with frequent updates

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Connected to `staging` branch
   - Mirrors production configuration
   - Used for pre-production testing and verification

3. **Production Environment**:
   - Connected to `production` branch (or `main`)
   - Stable, highly available configuration
   - Enhanced security and monitoring

Each environment has its own isolated AWS resources, including:
- Separate Cognito User Pools
- Dedicated AppSync APIs
- Environment-specific DynamoDB tables
- Isolated Lambda functions

## Deployment Workflow
