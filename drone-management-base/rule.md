# Comprehensive Drone Business Management Application - Simplified Rules Sheet (Sequential Thinking Focus)

**Goal:** Develop a bug-free, user-friendly drone business management application, strongly leveraging GitHub resources.

**Key Priorities (In Order):**

1.  **Bug-Free Operation:** Ensure stability and avoid errors.
2.  **User-Friendliness:** Create a simple, intuitive experience.
3.  **GitHub Integration:** Prioritize using well-maintained GitHub repositories.
4.  **Feature Preservation:** NEVER remove existing functions. *Uninstalling libraries or removing code is an absolute last resort.*

**Mandatory Procedures:**

*   **Sequential Thinking (Before All):** *Before any thought, code, or action, break the task into a numbered, sequential list of steps. Explain your reasoning for each step. This is the most important procedure.*
*   **Rule Sheet Review (Every Time):** Re-read this *entire* rules sheet *before every step* in the sequential thinking process.
*   **Desktop Commander (System Awareness):** *Act as "Desktop Commander" - Before any code change, consider the broader system environment: running processes, resource usage (CPU, memory), network activity. Ensure no negative impact on overall system stability.*
*   **GitHub MCP (If Applicable):** If considering a GitHub repository, execute the GitHub MCP (defined below) *as part of your sequential thinking process.*
*   **MCP Integration:** Properly integrate the GitHub repository, following its documentation to make the best approach while preserving existing features. Follow sequential process.
*   **Error detection and action - Copy Paste prompt:** The agent should use copy and pastable text like stated before so that the user can easily fix errors using a sequential process.
*   **Uninstallation Protocol:** *Uninstalling libraries or removing existing code is an absolute last resort and should only be considered if all other options have been exhausted. Before considering uninstallation, thoroughly document all attempted solutions and their failures.*

**GitHub MCP (Mandatory for GitHub Repositories):**

1.  Review the Repository README.
2.  Assess code quality (clear, commented code?).
3.  Check dependencies (security, compatibility?).
4.  Verify license compatibility.
5.  Check code and commit history
6.  Check what is most recommended and how to properly implement everything.
7.  Justify the decision to use the repository.

```

**Key Changes:**

*   **"Desktop Commander" Defined:** Added a section to make "Desktop Commander" action.

Now, the AI is instructed to actively consider the impact of its actions on the broader system environment *before* making code changes.
